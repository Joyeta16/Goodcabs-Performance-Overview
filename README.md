![overview (1) (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e18f4f14-fcae-4abb-94c6-92576e631fe5) ## Company Overview


GoodCabs, established two years ago, has quickly become a leading cab service provider in India's tier-II cities. Unlike traditional competitors, GoodCabs is driven by a mission to empower local drivers, helping them build sustainable livelihoods within their communities while providing passengers with exceptional service. Operating across 10 tier-II cities, GoodCabs combines a community-focused approach with a commitment to delivering a seamless travel experience. It aims to solidify its position as a trusted mobility partner in underserved markets.

👍 ## Problem Statement

Goodcabs has been operating in tier-II cities for two years, but it is still far from reaching its market penetration goals. Despite establishing a solid presence in these areas, the company is struggling to meet its ambitious 2024 targets. 
To overcome this challenge, Goodcabs needs an in-depth analysis of key performance metrics—such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, retention rates, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. This analysis will help identify critical growth opportunities and resolve operational inefficiencies that are hindering progress.
